Novavax itself wasn’t immune from the downdraft it created, with the stock reversing a 9.5% gain on Monday to close down about 1%.

Novavax now has “a viable alternative to mRNA vaccines,” like Pfizer and BioNTech or Moderna’s shots, an analyst at Jefferies said. But with Novavax up 86% so far this year and after a more than 2,700% leap in 2020, it wasn’t enough to further bolster shares. Biotech stocks often climb ahead of highly watched catalysts, only to give back gains even after a positive update. Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
