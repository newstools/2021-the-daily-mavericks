The billionaire said the sale was done “to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.” His tweet was in reply to a report in Cointelegraph, which cited Magda Wierzycka, executive chair of South African asset manager Sygnia, as saying Musk’s recent tweets on Bitcoin should have prompted an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market. When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 13, 2021 The cryptocurrency was up 4.1% to $37,494.43 as of 2:59 p.m. in New York. The billionaire has whipsawed Bitcoin and other digital tokens with a string of social media posts in the past few months.
