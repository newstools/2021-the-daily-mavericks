Score the skin of the knuckle in a diamond pattern, being careful not to cut through the meat. Heat olive oil in a heavy pot that has a lid. Brown the shank well on all sides. Add the onions all around and simmer, stirring, for a few minutes. Add the slices of apple. Heat the stock and add the marsala. Pour this into the pot. Add the mace and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, lightly. You can adjust the seasoning later, once it’s cooked. Cover and put it in the oven. After 10 minutes, turn the heat down to 160℃ or 170℃. Braise for about 3 hours or until the meat is fall-apart tender. Serve with shredded cabbage stir-fried with salt, pepper and one or two of those ground spices generally ignored in the spice cupboard.
