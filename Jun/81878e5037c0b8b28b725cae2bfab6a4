Potato bake with sweetcorn and chakalaka. (Photo: Tony Jackman)  The little shop behind the hotel had no cream, but I spied cans of sweetcorn and chakalaka on their shelves and thought, why not? Everyone kept saying how wonderful the potato bake smelled whenever they walked through the kitchen. Ingredients 4 to 6 potatoes, peeled and sliced thinly Salt to taste Pepper to taste Knobs of butter and more to grease the oven dish 2 x 400 g cans sweetcorn 1 x 400 g can chakalaka 250 ml chicken stock Method Preheat the oven to 190℃. Grease a suitable oven dish with butter. Peel and slice the potatoes and lay out in the dish. Season with a little salt and pepper and dot with butter. Empty half a can of sweetcorn and half a can of chakalaka in and smooth it out with the back of a dessert spoon so that the sweetcorn and chakalaka spread out evenly. Lay out two or three more layers of potatoes, seasoning each layer, adding more sweetcorn and chakalaka between layers until it is used up. Spread any remaining sweetcorn over the top potato layer, and pour the stock over. Bake for 90 minutes to two hours or until the potatoes are soft.
