Danny will likely make landfall Monday evening and may dump as much as 3 inches (8 centimeters) of rain on the region. However, because the region hasn’t had much rain lately, widespread flooding isn’t likely. Almost 25% of South Carolina is abnormally dry, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The storm is forecast to head northwest across South Carolina and Georgia before breaking up and won’t pose a threat to energy production in the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical Storm Claudette slammed into the Gulf Coast earlier this month, bringing flooding rains and killing at least at least a dozen across the South.
