Campaigners motored around the bay and harbour with an inflatable of President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson this morning calling on G7 leaders to 'crack the crisis' on June 11, 2021 in Falmouth, England. Environmental Protest Groups gather in Cornwall as the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, hosts leaders from the USA, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada at the G7 Summit in Carbis Bay. This year the UK has invited Australia, India, South Africa and South Korea to attend the Leaders' Summit as guest countries as well as the EU. Protest groups hope to highlight their various causes to the G7 leaders and a global audience as the eyes of the world focus on Cornwall during the summit.
