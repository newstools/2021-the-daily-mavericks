A Unicef multimedia truck is touring South Africa to encourage people in rural areas to get vaccinated for Covid-19. (Photo: Supplied by GroundUp) First published by GroundUp. To help people in a rural Western Cape area get vaccinated against Covid-19, Unicef is using a truck to register people on the governmentâ€™s Electronic Vaccination Data System (EVDS). The truck is also raising vaccine awareness. When this video was shot fewer than half of people over 60 in South Africa were registered on the government system. While this is a great initiative, it does raise the question: why not simply vaccinate people at the same time as registering them?  DM  "Information pertaining to Covid-19, vaccines, how to control the spread of the virus and potential treatments is ever-changing. Under the South African Disaster Management Act Regulation 11(5)(c) it is prohibited to publish information through any medium with the intention to deceive people on government measures to address COVID-19.
