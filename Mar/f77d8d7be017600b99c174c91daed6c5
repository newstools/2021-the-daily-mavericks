Easy mayo rolls, or muffins if you prefer. (Photo: Tony Jackman) 2 cups self-rising flour 4 Tbsp mayonnaise 1 cup/ 250 ml full cream milk 1 tsp sugar Method Mix all ingredients in a mixing bowl for about two minutes with a wooden spoon. Spray large-cavity muffin tins. Fill tins two-thirds full. Bake in a preheated hot oven (240℃) until golden brown; about 10 to 12 minutes.

Or you can make the rolls more herby by adding dried mixed herbs.
