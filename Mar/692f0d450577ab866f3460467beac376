A bodybuilder gets ready before going on stage during the Iron Fit Bodybuilding competition in Nairobi on December 05, 2020. 130 participants from all across East Africa took part in the second edition of this competition which included categories like Bikini, Figure, Physique and Bodybuilding. In March 2020, Kenya halted all sporting activities to stop the spread of Covid-19, alongside other measures such as closing borders and schools, and imposing a nighttime curfew. Six months later, Sports Minister Amina Mohamed gave the green light for non-contact sports to resume, allowing fitness enthusiasts to participate in the second Iron Fit Bodybuilding competition in Nairobi. One hundred and thirty athletes from all across East Africa took part in this event, which included categories such as Bikini, Figure, Physique and Bodybuilding. © Patrick Meinhardt, Spain, Finalist, Professional, Sport, 2021 Sony World Photography Awards Portraiture category *** Sport category Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
