Minimalistic still life with a cat and chamomile. So often in modern art, and particularly in photography, cats are relegated to a position of comedy. I couldn't help wondering why they shouldn’t instead be portrayed differently. Having worked in both classical and conceptual still life for a long time, I decided to try something unusual – allowing these beautiful animals to interact with objects, backgrounds and light. Yes, my colleagues were right about one thing – it's difficult. But I proved that it is possible. I feel I’ve also shown that cats are not only a source of amusement but that they can act as serious models, too. © Igor Kryukov, Russian Federation, Shortlist, Professional, Still Life, 2021 Sony World Photography Awards Still life Creative Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.
