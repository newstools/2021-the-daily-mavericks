Read more: How sneakerheads turned Jordans and Yeezys into an asset class The executive had spent more than 25 years with the Beaverton, Oregon-based company, which said it would announce a new leader for North America shortly. Bloomberg Businessweek’s latest cover article explored the story of Joe Hebert, Ann’s son, a college dropout who makes a living as a sneaker reseller.
