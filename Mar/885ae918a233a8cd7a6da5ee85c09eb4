Thai monks take part in a chanting ceremony at Wat Dhammakaya on Makha Bucha Day on February 26, 2021 in Bangkok, Thailand. Makha Bucha Day is one of the holiest days in Buddhism and is celebrated on the full moon of the third lunar month. The holiday commemorates the day when 1,250 monks gathered to be ordained by Buddha. The Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple in Pathum Thani province hosts a large gathering of 1,000 monks with 100,000 candles. While thousands usually visit the temple for Makha Bucha day, this year, due to the spread of COVID-19, Wat Phra Dhammakaya hosted over 200,000 virtual devotees via a worldwide zoom conference call.
