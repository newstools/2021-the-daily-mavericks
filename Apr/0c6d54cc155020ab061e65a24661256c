(Photo: Raymond Joseph) The National Lotteries Commission (NLC) has, since 2016, spent over R8-million in litigation against former employees, most of whom had claimed that they were unfairly dismissed. This includes over R5.7-million in a legal battle with a former employee. Mzukisi Makatse was suspended and accused of insubordination after he refused to sign off on a payment of R6-million in 2017 for a proactively funded grant for the Buyel’Ekhaya Festival in East London. GroundUp last week revealed how the NLC has spent tens of millions of rands on litigation and other fees to lawyers since 2016, including almost R8.2-million on litigation against former staff members who are suing the Commission for unfair dismissal. Here is recent NLC litigation involving former staff and, in one case, an existing staff member: The list of cases and costs given to Parliament exclude cases involving Tshepo Chuene and Sello Qhino, who are both contesting their axing, claiming their dismissals were unfair. Both are waiting for dates for when their matters will come before the CCMA. DM  Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment. Sign up here or sign in if you are already an Insider.
