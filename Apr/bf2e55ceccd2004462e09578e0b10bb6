Harry will appear on camera in the documentary series called “Heart of Invictus” and serve as an executive producer through the couple’s Archewell Productions, Netflix said in a statement on Tuesday. The series will provide behind-the-scenes stories of athletes and organizers as they prepare for the event, which has been delayed until next spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Netflix said. Orlando von Einsiedel will direct the multi-episode series and Joanna Natasegara will be its producer, Netflix said. The duo produced the Oscar-winning short documentary “The White Helmets” about a rescue group in Syria. The Invictus Games is a multi-sport event created in 2017 by Prince Harry – who served as a soldier in Afghanistan – for military personnel wounded in action. The couple, who has been in the news following an interview with U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey last month, signed a multi-year production deal with Netflix in September.
