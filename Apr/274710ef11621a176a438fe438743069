Tony Jackman’s biltong and blue cheese paté has a hint of cumin and lemon. (Photo: Tony Jackman) Ingredients 450 g cream cheese 50 g blue cheese, crumbled or cut up 180 g soft biltong, a bit fatty, sliced 2 Tbsp lemon juice ½ tsp ground cumin Grinding of black pepper Method Put everything in a bowl. Blitz like mad until the biltong is in tiny bits, but leave it a bit chunky for texture. I served it with wonderfully crunchy black rice crackers from Woolies.
