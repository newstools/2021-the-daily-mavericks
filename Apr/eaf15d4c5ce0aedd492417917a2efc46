Designer and creative entrepreneur Thabisa Mjo answers our 20 questions. Can’t choose one; Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Destined to Reign by Joseph Prince. Bush. The joy of playing blissfully outside with all your little neighbourhood friends. Hmmm, the fact that I’m actually doing it, working full time as a designer, that’s the highlight.

The night before I’ll obsessively plan out my route and think and re-think about all the things that could happen on the way to make me late. None, I’m afraid. I’m more the “woman of mystery” in my head than in reality, lol. Head weaver at Mash. T. Clay beads?
