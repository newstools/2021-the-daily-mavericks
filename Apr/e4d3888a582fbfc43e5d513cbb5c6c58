A greyhound is seen wearing a dress at the 'Interpets' international pet fair in Tokyo, Japan, 01 April 2021. As the coronavirus pandemic is limiting access from abroad, some 300 exhibitors based in Japan will present their products to business visitors and pet lovers until 04 April at the event, which is the largest international trade fair in the Japanese pet market. With the COVID-19 pandemic, pets are giving comfort to people who are spending more time home due to lockdowns and telework, boosting the pet products market.
