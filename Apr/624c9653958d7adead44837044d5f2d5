(Photo: Louis Pieterse)  This recipe accompanies this story Ingredients 1.5 kg makataan flesh from the centre of the melon, pips removed 500 g pears, peeled and chopped 1 lemon, sliced thinly 1 lime, sliced thinly 1 orange, sliced thinly Juice of 2 limes 7 cups white sugar 1 cup caramel sugar 1 cinnamon stick 2 litres water Method Put everything in a huge heavy pot. Bring to a boil, stirring, and keep stirring until the sugar has all dissolved. Boil rapidly until it has reached setting stage. Test this by putting a dessert spoon in the freezer until needed. When the syrup has reduced by about half, start doing tests at 3 to 5 minute intervals. Pour a little of the syrup onto the chilled spoon (using a teaspoon) and return the dessert spoon to the freezer for 2 minutes. Take it out and look at it, tilting the spoon this way and that. It should be fairly stiff but move just a little. More sensibly, it should look and feel like jam as you know it should be. This is a skill that comes with practice, but you should be able to pull it off. When it’s right, bottle in sterilised jars, up to the brim.
