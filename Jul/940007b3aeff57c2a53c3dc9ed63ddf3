1) Now that JZ is in jail, surely we need to bring an application to have his “presidential benefits” removed? You know, being a criminal etc.? How do we do this?
2) Surely Edward “thick as mud” Zuma can be charged with clearly breaking lockdown regulations, but also a host of calls for violence etc. (unless he’s died and is in a ditch, then we can throw a party)
3) Who funded all those posters and the like? Surely it’s easy to track backwards, and charge them with organising multiple lockdown violations.
4) All those non-mask wearing people, clearly the C19 numbers will be going up, who can be charged with inciting this behaviour? There’s a real cost to this, and as always it’s us the taxpayers paying. At some point how do we get accountability for these buffoons acting like rules do not exist. I’ll settle for point 1, but others would be a bonus.
