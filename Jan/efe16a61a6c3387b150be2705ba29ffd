(Image: Adobe Stock) South Africa officially entered its second wave of Covid-19 on 9 December 2020, according to Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize. There were pleas for holiday safely over the festive season and new rules to curb the spread in hotspots, and then the entire country.  More than a month later, the data shows that the second wave is reaching far more people than the first. New daily increases for infections, cases and hospitalisations have shattered what we thought was horrific in the first wave. Below are charts illustrating and comparing the pace of the pandemic through each province. Following this is an overview of where each province has come from since the first wave and where it stands according to the latest figures.    Western Cape The Western Cape reported 111,108 new Covid-19 infections between 9 December 2020 – when the nationwide second wave was declared – and 16 January 2021. This accounts for 43% of all cases ever reported by the province. New infections peaked at 2,149 cases on 29 June 2020 during the first wave; the second wave had already reached a high of 5,534 cases on 28 December 2021. So far in the second wave, the province reported 4,142 deaths. In the first wave, both 22 June and 30 June saw 70 deaths a day. On 28 December, this number increased to 209 on one day. Hospitalisations for Covid-19 have far surpassed that of the first wave in the Western Cape. By 15 December, more than 2,000 people were in hospital. Currently, there are 3,539. The increase in cases has stabilised and the number of deaths has decreased in the past two weeks – however, there are still 36,536 active cases and each one of the province’s six districts is classified as a hotspot. Eastern Cape In the Eastern Cape, 45,496 people tested positive for Covid-19 between 9 December and 16 January. The daily number of new cases had been decreasing over the past week from more than 1,000 new cases a day to just under 800. The current wave has reached a high of 2,187 new cases on 10 December – this is slightly lower than the first wave’s highest daily increase of 2,433 on 6 July. The province’s most deadly day has been 6 January 2021, when 452 were reported to have died from Covid-19. The first wave’s most deadly day was 22 July when 400 people died. Daily Covid-19 deaths have stayed around 100 since 6 December 2020. In total, the province lost 4,306 people to Covid-19 since 9 December. It presently has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in the country. Hospital admissions exceeded that of the first wave in early November and remained above 1,500 from the start of December. It now sits at 1,535. Seven of the province’s eight districts have been declared hotspots. Only the Joe Gqabi district is not a hotspot. The province has 8,411 active cases. Northern Cape The second wave has seen 5,829 more people infected with Covid-19 in the Northern Cape. On 16 January, the province recorded 381 new cases – during the first wave, it recorded a high of 373 new cases on 18 September. Since 9 December, 3,506 people have recovered from Covid-19. However, 100 more people have died of Covid-19 since 1 January 2021, bringing the total to 490. This is compared with the previous 100 fatalities which took place between 5 November 2020 and 1 January 2021. This province’s hospitalisations increased gradually from July to October before decreasing until the beginning of December. In the past month hospital admissions have risen from 190 to 347. None of its districts is presently a hotspot and there are 4,333 active cases. KwaZulu-Natal Since 9 December, 142,610 people have contracted Covid-19 in this province.
