All Comments 3 Regarding Trump’s claim to having the ‘biggest’ audience at his inauguration, Biden (if he was so inclined – but is not) could claim to have the biggest audience of American flags at his inauguration ! “Members of the Communist Party USA and other anti-fascist groups burn an American flag on the steps of the Colorado State Capitol on January 20, 2021 in Denver, Colorado.
