Water and electricity have been cut off in Sisakht,” a local official in the province of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad told the TV. “Rescue teams and ambulances have been dispatched to the area…So far 10 people have been injured.” The state news agency IRNA said the quake, felt in several cities and towns in the region, struck at a depth of 10 km (6 miles) at 10:05 p.m. local time (1835 GMT). “There are still no reports of fatalities,” IRNA said.
