Jacob Zuma boldly told the Zondo Commission – and the world – in a statement released on Monday by the Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma Foundation, that he would not appear before the commission. Zuma’s decision went against the Constitutional Court order last week that he must appear before the commission, give evidence and obey all the directives given by the inquiry. Justice Chris Jafta said: “It is declared that Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma does not have the right to remain silent in proceedings before the Commission.” On Monday 1 February, Zuma seemed to taunt the commission, with his statement that he would not cooperate and that: “If this stance is considered a violation of their law, then let their law take its course.” The commission is not taking this lightly and has released its own statement. “The Commission takes note of the recent public statement issued by Mr Jacob Zuma yesterday (Monday, 1 February 2021).”  Media Statement 2 February … by Daily Maverick  The statement describes the stance taken by Zuma and goes on to say: “It seems that Mr Zuma considers himself to be above the law and the Constitution. “With regard to Mr Zuma’s decision not to appear before the Commission during the week of the 18th to the 22nd of January 2021 as he had been required to do in terms of one of the Commission’s summonses served on him, the Chairperson has asked the Secretary of the Commission to lay a criminal complaint against Mr Zuma.” Zuma is also expected to appear before the commission from February 15 to 19, which he announced he would not do. The commission has noted this and said should Zuma not appear on 15 February, it would “announce on that day what further action it will take in regard to such conduct”. The commission closed its statement with: “It is noted that in his statement Mr Zuma continues his attacks on the person and integrity of the chairperson but the chairperson will deal with those attacks in a separate statement.” DM Please note you must be a Maverick Insider to comment.

Be assured that if it were you or me or Joe Citizen, we’d be bitten by the full might of the law. Let’s see where this goes with this clown…… At last he will have his day in court. Zuma has another time delay, 15th February, and then action still to be decided by the Commission. Enough time to have next step ready and no more delays. Only after he does not appear can they lay more charges.. By the time our overstretched criminal justice system finishes their investigation it will be end of March, end of Zondo commission and the slithery eel will be free again. QUOTE: The commission has noted this and said should Zuma not appear on 15 February, it would “announce on that day what further action it will take in regard to such conduct”. If he doesn’t appear = contempt = a warrant of arrest. End of the story. and bail with money stolen from taxpayers on the same day, and then he starts playing the system again.. 😣 Cyril must call his bluff and forget the bussed-in rabble that will howl at his court appearance . South Africa as a whole (forget the ANC) will back you up. Take him (Zuma) down! Ray It makes no sense for Mr Zuma to appear before the commission. What can he possibly say? I didn’t steal the money? If they don’t charge him NOW and remove his passport, and as part of his bail conditions, state that he may not leave the country, he will not be in SA on the 15th February. Just saying: nobody commenting thinks the state will arrest him. That’s how cynical we’ve become. The time-frame of the Commission needs to be extended to deal with the increasing volume and gravity of widespread malfeasance & ANC looting – the extent of which is only just beginning to surface. Zuma too will engineer room to wiggle out of his situation if this is not done.
It’s up to you mr Pres. Do the right thing!
