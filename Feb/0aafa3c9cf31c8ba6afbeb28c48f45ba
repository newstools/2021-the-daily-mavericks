When it is hot, brown the shanks one at a time, all over, then add all the browned shanks, the grated ginger, orange peel, and sage leaves, and leave, covered, to cook while you prepare the stock. Squeeze the juice of an orange into a measuring jug, then add stock to make up 500 ml altogether.

Keep the coals regular throughout the cooking time of between 2 and 3 hours.
