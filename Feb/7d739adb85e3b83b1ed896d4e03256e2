Like most things sweet and memorable, Ice Cream for Breakfast Day was invented by a mom. Let’s time travel to the 1960s. It’s a cold and snowy morning in New York, and Florence Rappaport can tell that her kids are bored. The little ones told her it was too cold to do anything fun, so she came up with a bright idea: Have ice cream for breakfast. The following year, Florence’s kids reminded her of the holiday, and before they knew it, it became a family tradition. The holiday caught on thanks to Florence’s grandkids, who were seasoned globetrotters. Fast forward to today, and Ice Cream for Breakfast Day is celebrated all over the world, from Nepal to Namibia. This is probably one of the easiest holidays to celebrate. Wake up, grab a sweet NiceCream treat and enjoy. Most people will celebrate by scooping some ice cream into a bowl, but there are plenty of tastier and more enjoyable alternatives. You could start the morning with an ice cream stick, a plate of oh-so-sweet waffles or an indulgent sundae. On a day dedicated to savouring ice cream first thing in the morning, it’s only appropriate to learn some trivia about everyone’s favourite frozen treat: Not many food holidays are worth celebrating, but Ice Cream for Breakfast Day is a call to action that can’t be ignored. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying a morning scoop of ice cream any other day of the year, Ice Cream for Breakfast Day is the excuse plenty of people have been waiting for.
