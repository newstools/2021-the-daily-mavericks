Old-fashioned cream of celery soup. (Photo: Tony Jackman) Ingredients 3 Tbsp butter 4 cups celery 1 fat garlic clove, chopped 2 medium onions, chopped 1 ½ cups chicken stock 250 ml double thick cream 1 cup/ 250 ml full cream milk Salt (about 1 scant tsp) and a couple of grindings of pepper to taste Method Melt the butter and sauté the onions and garlic for a minute. Add the chopped celery all at once and continue to sauté, stirring. Add chicken (or use vegetable) stock and cook for a few minutes, then add the milk and cream and simmer, stirring now and then, until it thickens a little and the flavours have developed. Blend thoroughly, heat through, and serve. There should be no need to thicken it but you can thicken with a little cornflour dissolved in milk if your soup seems a tad runny. I served it with butter-fried croutons of plain day-old white bread.
