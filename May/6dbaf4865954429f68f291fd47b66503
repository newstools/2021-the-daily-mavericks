Word Count: 281 Two doses of the Covid-19 vaccines were “highly effective” against the B.1.617.2 strain first detected in India, the agency said in a statement. There was minimal difference with how the inoculations work on a variant detected in Kent, it said. “We expect the vaccines to be even more effective at preventing hospitalization and death,” said Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at PHE. “So it is vital to get both doses to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging variants.” The results are likely to boost the U.K. government’s plan to end its lockdown on June 21 even as cases of the variant have been rising rapidly.

There’s also data showing the AstraZeneca inoculation takes longer to reach maximum effectiveness, according to the agency. © 2021 Bloomberg L.P.
