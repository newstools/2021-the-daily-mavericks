The Crescent Observers Society (COS) and Muslim clergy gather for the annual sighting of the moon at Three Anchor Bay on April 12, 2021 in Cape Town, South Africa. The sighting of the moon marks the month of Ramadan which marks the onset of fasting among Muslims across the world. The moon was not seen so the fast will start on Wednesday.
