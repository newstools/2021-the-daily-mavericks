 Only five flights a day from and to Algerian airports will be allowed “with full adherence to strict precautions”, it said in a statement after a cabinet meeting chaired by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. More details would be announced in a week, it added. Algeria closed borders and suspended all flights in March 2020 when the number of COVID-19 infections started to increase, but domestic flights resumed in December last year. The North African country has so far recorded 125,311 coronavirus cases, including 3,374 deaths.
