This was an error made by a designer who could not fit all the wording in and I did not check the final abridged version, so this is ultimately my error. The caption should have read, “… add your name to the list of SA Jews who oppose the recent (and ongoing) actions of the state of Israel.” I apologise to all of the people whose names appeared on the petition, and to the organisers of the petition, for any harm or misunderstanding this error may have caused.

All Comments 2 Those petition signing South Africans of “Jewish origin” are a sorry bunch. They are so keen to be accepted by their intellectual equals that they play the good-Jew-bad -Jew card. They of course being the good ones. They have forgetten that to the anti semite a Jew is a Jew is a Jew. You are entitled to your opinion … so why would you deny those who differ with you ? Part of the ‘let us dominate and try to control’ the narrative maybe ?
