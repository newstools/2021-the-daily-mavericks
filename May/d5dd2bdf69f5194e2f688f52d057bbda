Rosemary salt. (Photo: Louis Pieterse) This recipe accompanies this column. Ingredients 1 cup/ 225 g coarse salt 1 cup/ 225 g rosemary needles 1 cup/ 225 g fine salt Method Put the coarse salt and the rosemary needles in a blender or grinder and blitz until fairly fine. Spread it out on a baking tray, put it in a warm place and leave for a few hours to dry out. Scrape it around with a spatula now and then to even out the drying. Pour it into a suitable bowl and stir in the fine salt. Store in an airtight jar and use as you like, on steak, chops or chicken for the braai, to season a savoury sauce or soup, or sprinkle a little on your fried eggs, or use it to give a lift to a fillet of fish you’re grilling.
