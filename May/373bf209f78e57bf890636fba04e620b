Simple but delicious avocado salad with plenty of zing. (Photo: Tony Jackman) Ingredients 1 large buttery Natal avocado or 2 smaller ones Juice of ½ a lemon 1 sweet long red pepper, cut into thin strips lengthwise ½ an orange, sliced into thin half moon segments 12 mini Roma tomatoes 12 black olives 8 mustard leaves, torn Fresh oregano, picked Dressing: Juice of 1 lime 3 Tbsp olive oil 1 Tbsp finely chopped coriander stems The finely chopped soft centre of 1 stick of lemongrass (none of the hard outer part) 1 Tbsp brown rice vinegar Salt and pepper to taste Method Combine dressing ingredients in a bowl and stir. Pour half of it into a salad bowl. Tear the green part of the mustard leaves away from their stems, put them in the bowl and toss with the dressing. Peel and halve the avos and drizzle lemon juice all over, rubbing it in gently. Slice nearly all the way through leaving the narrow part intact. Arrange creatively on the leaves. Arrange the pepper strips, orange segments, tomatoes and olives. Pick some oregano leaves and drop them here and there. Drizzle the remaining dressing over.
